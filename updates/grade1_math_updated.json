        "content": "### What Are Addition Word Problems?\nAddition word problems tell a story where we need to combine or add numbers together. They use key words like:\n- **Join together**\n- **In all**\n- **Total**\n- **Combined**\n\n### How to Solve Addition Word Problems:\n1. **Read** the problem carefully\n2. **Identify** what we're adding (objects, people, animals)\n3. **Find** the numbers we need to add\n4. **Write** an equation using numbers and the + sign\n5. **Solve** the equation\n\n### Example 1:\nMaria has 5 red crayons and 7 blue crayons. How many crayons does she have in all?\n- What we're adding: **crayons**\n- Numbers to add: **5 and 7**\n- Equation: **5 + 7 = 12**\n- Answer: **Maria has 12 crayons in all.**\n\n### Example 2:\nThere are 8 children on the playground. Then 6 more children join them. How many children are on the playground now?\n- What we're adding: **children**\n- Numbers to add: **8 and 6**\n- Equation: **8 + 6 = 14**\n- Answer: **There are 14 children on the playground.**\n\n### Using Pictures to Solve Problems:\nDrawing can help us solve word problems:\n1. Draw the first amount (e.g., 5 circles for 5 apples)\n2. Draw the second amount (e.g., 3 more circles for 3 more apples)\n3. Count all the circles to find the total\n\n### Addition with Unknown Numbers:\nSometimes we know the total but not one of the parts:\n- Sam has 7 stickers. How many more does he need to have 10 stickers?\n- Equation: 7 + ? = 10\n- Solution: 10 - 7 = 3, so he needs 3 more stickers"

        "content": "### Adding Three Numbers at Once\nWhen we need to add three numbers together, we can use special strategies to make it easier.\n\n### Strategy 1: Make a Ten\nLook for pairs of numbers that add up to 10. This makes adding easier!\n\n**Example:**\n4 + 6 + 5 = ?\n- First, find numbers that make 10: 4 + 6 = 10\n- Then add the remaining number: 10 + 5 = 15\n- Answer: 4 + 6 + 5 = 15\n\n### Strategy 2: Add in Any Order\nYou can add numbers in any order and get the same sum. This is called the **commutative** and **associative** properties.\n\n**Example:**\n3 + 8 + 2 = ?\n- It might be easier to add: 3 + 2 + 8\n- First: 3 + 2 = 5\n- Then: 5 + 8 = 13\n- Answer: 3 + 8 + 2 = 13\n\n### Strategy 3: Use Doubles\nIf you see a double (like 4 + 4), use your knowledge of doubles to add quickly.\n\n**Example:**\n4 + 4 + 3 = ?\n- Double fact: 4 + 4 = 8\n- Then: 8 + 3 = 11\n- Answer: 4 + 4 + 3 = 11\n\n### Real-Life Example:\nTom has 5 red marbles, 7 blue marbles, and 3 green marbles. How many marbles does he have altogether?\n- Add in the easiest order: 5 + 3 + 7\n- First: 5 + 3 = 8 (easier to work with)\n- Then: 8 + 7 = 15\n- Tom has 15 marbles altogether.\n\n### Visual Method:\nDrawing pictures or using blocks can help you see all three groups and count the total."

        "content": "### The Magic of Changing Order (Commutative Property)\nThe commutative property tells us that we can add numbers in any order and get the same answer!\n\n**Examples:**\n- 3 + 5 = 8 and 5 + 3 = 8\n- 4 + 7 = 11 and 7 + 4 = 11\n\n### Why Is This Helpful?\nThis property helps us solve problems more easily. We can start with the larger number to count on:\n- Instead of 2 + 9, think 9 + 2\n- Start at 9 and count up 2 more: 10, 11\n\n### Grouping Numbers Differently (Associative Property)\nThe associative property means we can group numbers in different ways when adding three or more numbers.\n\n**Example:**\n(2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4)\n- (2 + 3) + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9\n- 2 + (3 + 4) = 2 + 7 = 9\n\n### Why Is This Helpful?\nThis property helps us make easier number combinations like tens:\n\n**Example:**\n8 + 7 + 2 = ?\n- Regrouping: 8 + 2 + 7\n- (8 + 2) + 7 = 10 + 7 = 17\n\n### Fun Activities to Try:\n1. **Number Hunt:** Find different pairs that make the same sum\n2. **Number Chains:** Find different ways to group three numbers\n\n### Remember:\n- Addition can be done in any order (commutative)\n- Addition can be grouped in different ways (associative)\n- Both properties help us add numbers more easily!"

        "title": "The Subtraction Connection",
        "content": "### The Addition-Subtraction Connection\nSubtraction and addition are connected! Every subtraction problem can be thought of as a missing addend problem.\n\n### What Is a Missing Addend?\nA missing addend is the number we need to add to get to a certain sum.\n\n**Example:**\n5 + ? = 12\nThe missing addend is 7 because 5 + 7 = 12\n\n### Connecting to Subtraction:\nThe missing addend (7) is the same as the answer to a subtraction problem:\n12 - 5 = 7\n\n### Thinking About Subtraction as Addition:\nWhen we see: 10 - 4 = ?\nWe can think: 4 + ? = 10\n\n**Examples:**\n- 9 - 3 = ? → Think: 3 + ? = 9 → Answer: 6\n- 15 - 8 = ? → Think: 8 + ? = 15 → Answer: 7\n\n### Why This Helps:\n1. Sometimes it's easier to think about what number to add\n2. It helps with mental math strategies\n3. It builds a stronger understanding of how addition and subtraction are related\n\n### Real-Life Example:\nJamie has $7 but needs $10 to buy a toy. How much more money does Jamie need?\n\nWe can solve this two ways:\n- Subtraction: $10 - $7 = $3\n- Missing addend: $7 + ? = $10 → $3\n\n### Fact Families:\nAdd and subtract with the same numbers to see the relationship:\n- 6 + 5 = 11\n- 5 + 6 = 11\n- 11 - 5 = 6\n- 11 - 6 = 5"

        "title": "Smart Counting Methods",
        "content": "### Counting On Strategy\n**Counting on** is a mental math strategy where you start with the larger number and count up from there. It's faster than counting all numbers from the beginning.\n\n**Example:**\n6 + 3 = ?\n- Start with 6 (the larger number)\n- Count on 3 more: \"7, 8, 9\"\n- Answer: 6 + 3 = 9\n\n### When to Use Counting On:\n- When one number is much larger than the other\n- When you're comfortable counting from any starting point\n\n**Example:**\n24 + 2 = ?\n- Start with 24\n- Count on 2 more: \"25, 26\"\n- Answer: 24 + 2 = 26\n\n### Counting Back Strategy\n**Counting back** works well for subtraction. Start with the larger number and count backward.\n\n**Example:**\n8 - 3 = ?\n- Start with 8\n- Count back 3: \"7, 6, 5\"\n- Answer: 8 - 3 = 5\n\n### Counting by Groups\nCounting by 2s, 5s, or 10s helps us count larger collections quickly.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Counting by 2s: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10...\n- Counting by 5s: 5, 10, 15, 20...\n- Counting by 10s: 10, 20, 30, 40...\n\n### Using a Number Line\nA number line helps us visualize counting on and back:\n- To add: Jump forward on the number line\n- To subtract: Jump backward on the number line\n\n### Tips for Better Counting:\n1. Practice counting forward and backward from different starting points\n2. Use fingers to keep track of how many you've counted\n3. Look for patterns in numbers as you count"

Flashcards\n2. Number games\n3. Fact triangles\n4. Math fact songs or rhymes\n5. Regular practice (even 5 minutes per day helps!)"
