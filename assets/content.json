In this lesson, we will learn how to solve equations with one unknown variable.\n\nKey Concepts:\n1. An equation is a mathematical statement that asserts the equality of two expressions.\n2. A one-variable equation contains only one unknown, typically represented as x.\n3. To solve an equation, perform inverse operations to isolate the variable.\n\nSteps to Solve Equations:\n1. Identify the variable and the operations applied to it.\n2. Use the **inverse operation** to undo addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.\n3. Perform the same operation on **both sides** of the equation.\n4. Simplify step by step until the variable is isolated.\n\nExample Problems:\n1. Solve for x: x + 5 = 10\n   - Subtract 5 from both sides: x = 10 - 5\n   - Solution: x = 5\n\n2. Solve for x: 2x = 14\n   - Divide both sides by 2: x = 14 / 2\n   - Solution: x = 7\n\n3. Solve for x: 3x - 4 = 11\n   - Add 4 to both sides: 3x = 15\n   - Divide by 3: x = 5\n   - Solution: x = 5\n\n4. Solve for x: (x/2) + 3 = 7\n   - Subtract 3 from both sides: x/2 = 4\n   - Multiply by 2: x = 8\n   - Solution: x = 8\n\n5. Solve for x: 5(x - 2) = 20\n   - Divide by 5: x - 2 = 4\n   - Add 2: x = 6\n   - Solution: x = 6\n\nPractice these techniques to master solving one-variable equations!"
