How many crayons does she have in all?\n- What we're adding: **crayons**\n- Numbers to add: **5 and 7**\n- Equation: **5 + 7 = 12**\n- Answer: **Maria has 12 crayons in all.**\n\n### Example 2:\nThere are 8 children on the playground. Then 6 more children join them. How many children are on the playground now?\n- What we're adding: **children**\n- Numbers to add: **8 and 6**\n- Equation: **8 + 6 = 14**\n- Answer: **There are 14 children on the playground.**\n\n### Using Pictures to Solve Problems:\nDrawing can help us solve word problems:\n1. Draw the first amount (e.g., 5 circles for 5 apples)\n2. Draw the second amount (e.g., 3 more circles for 3 more apples)\n3. Count all the circles to find the total\n\n### Addition with Unknown Numbers:\nSometimes we know the total but not one of the parts:\n- Sam has 7 stickers. How many more does he need to have 10 stickers?\n- Equation: 7 + ? = 10\n- Solution: 10 - 7 = 3, so he needs 3 more stickers"

This makes adding easier!\n\n**Example:**\n4 + 6 + 5 = ?\n- First, find numbers that make 10: 4 + 6 = 10\n- Then add the remaining number: 10 + 5 = 15\n- Answer: 4 + 6 + 5 = 15\n\n### Strategy 2: Add in Any Order\nYou can add numbers in any order and get the same sum. This is called the **commutative** and **associative** properties.\n\n**Example:**\n3 + 8 + 2 = ?\n- It might be easier to add: 3 + 2 + 8\n- First: 3 + 2 = 5\n- Then: 5 + 8 = 13\n- Answer: 3 + 8 + 2 = 13\n\n### Strategy 3: Use Doubles\nIf you see a double (like 4 + 4), use your knowledge of doubles to add quickly.\n\n**Example:**\n4 + 4 + 3 = ?\n- Double fact: 4 + 4 = 8\n- Then: 8 + 3 = 11\n- Answer: 4 + 4 + 3 = 11\n\n### Real-Life Example:\nTom has 5 red marbles, 7 blue marbles, and 3 green marbles. How many marbles does he have altogether?\n- Add in the easiest order: 5 + 3 + 7\n- First: 5 + 3 = 8 (easier to work with)\n- Then: 8 + 7 = 15\n- Tom has 15 marbles altogether.\n\n### Visual Method:\nDrawing pictures or using blocks can help you see all three groups and count the total."

We can start with the larger number to count on:\n- Instead of 2 + 9, think 9 + 2\n- Start at 9 and count up 2 more: 10, 11\n\n### Grouping Numbers Differently (Associative Property)\nThe associative property means we can group numbers in different ways when adding three or more numbers.\n\n**Example:**\n(2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4)\n- (2 + 3) + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9\n- 2 + (3 + 4) = 2 + 7 = 9\n\n### Why Is This Helpful?\nThis property helps us make easier number combinations like tens:\n\n**Example:**\n8 + 7 + 2 = ?\n- Regrouping: 8 + 2 + 7\n- (8 + 2) + 7 = 10 + 7 = 17\n\n### Fun Activities to Try:\n1. **Number Hunt:** Find different pairs that make the same sum\n2. **Number Chains:** Find different ways to group three numbers\n\n### Remember:\n- Addition can be done in any order (commutative)\n- Addition can be grouped in different ways (associative)\n- Both properties help us add numbers more easily!"

Every subtraction problem can be thought of as a missing addend problem.\n\n### What Is a Missing Addend?\nA missing addend is the number we need to add to get to a certain sum.\n\n**Example:**\n5 + ? = 12\nThe missing addend is 7 because 5 + 7 = 12\n\n### Connecting to Subtraction:\nThe missing addend (7) is the same as the answer to a subtraction problem:\n12 - 5 = 7\n\n### Thinking About Subtraction as Addition:\nWhen we see: 10 - 4 = ?\nWe can think: 4 + ? = 10\n\n**Examples:**\n- 9 - 3 = ? → Think: 3 + ? = 9 → Answer: 6\n- 15 - 8 = ? → Think: 8 + ? = 15 → Answer: 7\n\n### Why This Helps:\n1. Sometimes it's easier to think about what number to add\n2. It helps with mental math strategies\n3. It builds a stronger understanding of how addition and subtraction are related\n\n### Real-Life Example:\nJamie has $7 but needs $10 to buy a toy. How much more money does Jamie need?\n\nWe can solve this two ways:\n- Subtraction: $10 - $7 = $3\n- Missing addend: $7 + ? = $10 → $3\n\n### Fact Families:\nAdd and subtract with the same numbers to see the relationship:\n- 6 + 5 = 11\n- 5 + 6 = 11\n- 11 - 5 = 6\n- 11 - 6 = 5"

It's faster than counting all numbers from the beginning.\n\n**Example:**\n6 + 3 = ?\n- Start with 6 (the larger number)\n- Count on 3 more: \"7, 8, 9\"\n- Answer: 6 + 3 = 9\n\n### When to Use Counting On:\n- When one number is much larger than the other\n- When you're comfortable counting from any starting point\n\n**Example:**\n24 + 2 = ?\n- Start with 24\n- Count on 2 more: \"25, 26\"\n- Answer: 24 + 2 = 26\n\n### Counting Back Strategy\n**Counting back** works well for subtraction. Start with the larger number and count backward.\n\n**Example:**\n8 - 3 = ?\n- Start with 8\n- Count back 3: \"7, 6, 5\"\n- Answer: 8 - 3 = 5\n\n### Counting by Groups\nCounting by 2s, 5s, or 10s helps us count larger collections quickly.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Counting by 2s: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10...\n- Counting by 5s: 5, 10, 15, 20...\n- Counting by 10s: 10, 20, 30, 40...\n\n### Using a Number Line\nA number line helps us visualize counting on and back:\n- To add: Jump forward on the number line\n- To subtract: Jump backward on the number line\n\n### Tips for Better Counting:\n1. Practice counting forward and backward from different starting points\n2. Use fingers to keep track of how many you've counted\n3. Look for patterns in numbers as you count"

This makes adding easier!\n\n**Example:**\n4 + 6 + 5 = ?\n- First, find numbers that make 10: 4 + 6 = 10\n- Then add the remaining number: 10 + 5 = 15\n- Answer: 4 + 6 + 5 = 15\n\n### Strategy 2: Add in Any Order\nYou can add numbers in any order and get the same sum. This is called the **commutative** and **associative** properties.\n\n**Example:**\n3 + 8 + 2 = ?\n- It might be easier to add: 3 + 2 + 8\n- First: 3 + 2 = 5\n- Then: 5 + 8 = 13\n- Answer: 3 + 8 + 2 = 13\n\n### Strategy 3: Use Doubles\nIf you see a double (like 4 + 4), use your knowledge of doubles to add quickly.\n\n**Example:**\n4 + 4 + 3 = ?\n- Double fact: 4 + 4 = 8\n- Then: 8 + 3 = 11\n- Answer: 4 + 4 + 3 = 11\n\n### Real-Life Example:\nTom has 5 red marbles, 7 blue marbles, and 3 green marbles. How many marbles does he have altogether?\n- Add in the easiest order: 5 + 3 + 7\n- First: 5 + 3 = 8 (easier to work with)\n- Then: 8 + 7 = 15\n- Tom has 15 marbles altogether.\n\n### Visual Method:\nDrawing pictures or using blocks can help you see all three groups and count the total."

Sometimes it's easier to think about what number to add\n2. It helps with mental math strategies\n3. It builds a stronger understanding of how addition and subtraction are related\n\n### Real-Life Example:\nJamie has $7 but needs $10 to buy a toy. How much more money does Jamie need?\n\nWe can solve this two ways:\n- Subtraction: $10 - $7 = $3\n- Missing addend: $7 + ? = $10 → $3\n\n### Fact Families:\nAdd and subtract with the same numbers to see the relationship:\n- 6 + 5 = 11\n- 5 + 6 = 11\n- 11 - 5 = 6\n- 11 - 6 = 5"

It's faster than counting all numbers from the beginning.\n\n**Example:**\n6 + 3 = ?\n- Start with 6 (the larger number)\n- Count on 3 more: \"7, 8, 9\"\n- Answer: 6 + 3 = 9\n\n### When to Use Counting On:\n- When one number is much larger than the other\n- When you're comfortable counting from any starting point\n\n**Example:**\n24 + 2 = ?\n- Start with 24\n- Count on 2 more: \"25, 26\"\n- Answer: 24 + 2 = 26\n\n### Counting Back Strategy\n**Counting back** works well for subtraction. Start with the larger number and count backward.\n\n**Example:**\n8 - 3 = ?\n- Start with 8\n- Count back 3: \"7, 6, 5\"\n- Answer: 8 - 3 = 5\n\n### Counting by Groups\nCounting by 2s, 5s, or 10s helps us count larger collections quickly.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Counting by 2s: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10...\n- Counting by 5s: 5, 10, 15, 20...\n- Counting by 10s: 10, 20, 30, 40...\n\n### Using a Number Line\nA number line helps us visualize counting on and back:\n- To add: Jump forward on the number line\n- To subtract: Jump backward on the number line\n\n### Tips for Better Counting:\n1. Practice counting forward and backward from different starting points\n2. Use fingers to keep track of how many you've counted\n3. Look for patterns in numbers as you count"

This makes adding easier!\n\n**Example:**\n4 + 6 + 5 = ?\n- First, find numbers that make 10: 4 + 6 = 10\n- Then add the remaining number: 10 + 5 = 15\n- Answer: 4 + 6 + 5 = 15\n\n### Strategy 2: Add in Any Order\nYou can add numbers in any order and get the same sum. This is called the **commutative** and **associative** properties.\n\n**Example:**\n3 + 8 + 2 = ?\n- It might be easier to add: 3 + 2 + 8\n- First: 3 + 2 = 5\n- Then: 5 + 8 = 13\n- Answer: 3 + 8 + 2 = 13\n\n### Strategy 3: Use Doubles\nIf you see a double (like 4 + 4), use your knowledge of doubles to add quickly.\n\n**Example:**\n4 + 4 + 3 = ?\n- Double fact: 4 + 4 = 8\n- Then: 8 + 3 = 11\n- Answer: 4 + 4 + 3 = 11\n\n### Real-Life Example:\nTom has 5 red marbles, 7 blue marbles, and 3 green marbles. How many marbles does he have altogether?\n- Add in the easiest order: 5 + 3 + 7\n- First: 5 + 3 = 8 (easier to work with)\n- Then: 8 + 7 = 15\n- Tom has 15 marbles altogether.\n\n### Visual Method:\nDrawing pictures or using blocks can help you see all three groups and count the total."

Sometimes it's easier to think about what number to add\n2. It helps with mental math strategies\n3. It builds a stronger understanding of how addition and subtraction are related\n\n### Real-Life Example:\nJamie has $7 but needs $10 to buy a toy.

Start with the larger number and count backward.\n\n**Example:**\n8 - 3 = ?\n- Start with 8\n- Count back 3: \"7, 6, 5\"\n- Answer: 8 - 3 = 5\n\n### Counting by Groups\nCounting by 2s, 5s, or 10s helps us count larger collections quickly.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Counting by 2s: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10...\n- Counting by 5s: 5, 10, 15, 20...\n- Counting by 10s: 10, 20, 30, 40...\n\n### Using a Number Line\nA number line helps us visualize counting on and back:\n- To add: Jump forward on the number line\n- To subtract: Jump backward on the number line\n\n### Tips for Better Counting:\n1. Practice counting forward and backward from different starting points\n2. Use fingers to keep track of how many you've counted\n3. Look for patterns in numbers as you count"

The main types are translations, reflections, rotations, and dilations.\n\n### Types of Transformations:\n1. **Translations (Slides)**: Move a figure in a straight line without rotating or flipping it.\n   - Example: Moving a triangle 3 units right and 2 units up.\n\n2. **Reflections (Flips)**: Mirror a figure across a line.\n   - Example: Reflecting a shape across the y-axis.\n\n3. **Rotations (Turns)**: Turn a figure around a fixed point.\n   - Example: Rotating a square 90° clockwise around the origin.\n\n4. **Dilations (Resizing)**: Enlarge or reduce a figure by a scale factor.\n   - Example: Enlarging a rectangle by a scale factor of 2.\n\n### Congruence and Transformations:\nTwo figures are **congruent** if one can be transformed into the other using only translations, reflections, and rotations (not dilations).\n\n### Applications:\n- **Computer Graphics**: Creating animations and visual effects.\n- **Architecture**: Designing symmetrical structures.\n- **Art**: Creating patterns and designs with symmetry.\n\nUnderstanding transformations helps in **analyzing geometric relationships and spatial reasoning**."

The main types are translations, reflections, rotations, and dilations.\n\n### Types of Transformations:\n1. **Translations (Slides)**: Move a figure in a straight line without rotating or flipping it.\n   - Example: Moving a triangle 3 units right and 2 units up.\n\n2. **Reflections (Flips)**: Mirror a figure across a line.\n   - Example: Reflecting a shape across the y-axis.\n\n3. **Rotations (Turns)**: Turn a figure around a fixed point.\n   - Example: Rotating a square 90° clockwise around the origin.\n\n4. **Dilations (Resizing)**: Enlarge or reduce a figure by a scale factor.\n   - Example: Enlarging a rectangle by a scale factor of 2.\n\n### Congruence and Transformations:\nTwo figures are **congruent** if one can be transformed into the other using only translations, reflections, and rotations (not dilations).\n\n### Applications:\n- **Computer Graphics**: Creating animations and visual effects.\n- **Architecture**: Designing symmetrical structures.\n- **Art**: Creating patterns and designs with symmetry.\n\nUnderstanding transformations helps in **analyzing geometric relationships and spatial reasoning**."

The main types are translations, reflections, rotations, and dilations.\n\n### Types of Transformations:\n1. **Translations (Slides)**: Move a figure in a straight line without rotating or flipping it.\n   - Example: Moving a triangle 3 units right and 2 units up.\n\n2. **Reflections (Flips)**: Mirror a figure across a line.\n   - Example: Reflecting a shape across the y-axis.\n\n3. **Rotations (Turns)**: Turn a figure around a fixed point.\n   - Example: Rotating a square 90° clockwise around the origin.\n\n4. **Dilations (Resizing)**: Enlarge or reduce a figure by a scale factor.\n   - Example: Enlarging a rectangle by a scale factor of 2.\n\n### Congruence and Transformations:\nTwo figures are **congruent** if one can be transformed into the other using only translations, reflections, and rotations (not dilations).\n\n### Applications:\n- **Computer Graphics**: Creating animations and visual effects.\n- **Architecture**: Designing symmetrical structures.\n- **Art**: Creating patterns and designs with symmetry.\n\nUnderstanding transformations helps in **analyzing geometric relationships and spatial reasoning**."

Two main types:\n1. **Transverse Waves:** Light, where particles vibrate perpendicular to the wave’s direction.\n2. **Longitudinal Waves:** Sound, where particles vibrate parallel to the wave’s direction.\n\n**Sound** travels as vibrations. Bats use echoes (sound reflection) to navigate in the dark!\n\n**Light** can:\n- **Reflect:** Mirrors bounce light back.\n- **Refract:** Light bends when passing through water (like a bent straw in a glass).\n\n**Fun Fact:** Lightning is seen before thunder is heard because light travels faster than sound!"
