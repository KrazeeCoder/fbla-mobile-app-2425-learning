They use key words like:\n- **Join together**\n- **In all**\n- **Total**\n- **Combined**\n\n### How to Solve Addition Word Problems:\n1. **Read** the problem carefully\n2. **Identify** what we're adding (objects, people, animals)\n3. **Find** the numbers we need to add\n4. **Write** an equation using numbers and the + sign\n5. **Solve** the equation\n\n### Example 1:\nMaria has 5 red crayons and 7 blue crayons. How many crayons does she have in all?\n- What we're adding: **crayons**\n- Numbers to add: **5 and 7**\n- Equation: **5 + 7 = 12**\n- Answer: **Maria has 12 crayons in all.**\n\n### Example 2:\nThere are 8 children on the playground. Then 6 more children join them. How many children are on the playground now?\n- What we're adding: **children**\n- Numbers to add: **8 and 6**\n- Equation: **8 + 6 = 14**\n- Answer: **There are 14 children on the playground.**\n\n### Using Pictures to Solve Problems:\nDrawing can help us solve word problems:\n1. Draw the first amount (e.g., 5 circles for 5 apples)\n2. Draw the second amount (e.g., 3 more circles for 3 more apples)\n3. Count all the circles to find the total\n\n### Addition with Unknown Numbers:\nSometimes we know the total but not one of the parts:\n- Sam has 7 stickers. How many more does he need to have 10 stickers?\n- Equation: 7 + ? = 10\n- Solution: 10 - 7 = 3, so he needs 3 more stickers"

This makes adding easier!\n\n**Example:**\n4 + 6 + 5 = ?\n- First, find numbers that make 10: 4 + 6 = 10\n- Then add the remaining number: 10 + 5 = 15\n- Answer: 4 + 6 + 5 = 15\n\n### Strategy 2: Add in Any Order\nYou can add numbers in any order and get the same sum. This is called the **commutative** and **associative** properties.\n\n**Example:**\n3 + 8 + 2 = ?\n- It might be easier to add: 3 + 2 + 8\n- First: 3 + 2 = 5\n- Then: 5 + 8 = 13\n- Answer: 3 + 8 + 2 = 13\n\n### Strategy 3: Use Doubles\nIf you see a double (like 4 + 4), use your knowledge of doubles to add quickly.\n\n**Example:**\n4 + 4 + 3 = ?\n- Double fact: 4 + 4 = 8\n- Then: 8 + 3 = 11\n- Answer: 4 + 4 + 3 = 11\n\n### Real-Life Example:\nTom has 5 red marbles, 7 blue marbles, and 3 green marbles. How many marbles does he have altogether?\n- Add in the easiest order: 5 + 3 + 7\n- First: 5 + 3 = 8 (easier to work with)\n- Then: 8 + 7 = 15\n- Tom has 15 marbles altogether.\n\n### Visual Method:\nDrawing pictures or using blocks can help you see all three groups and count the total."

We can start with the larger number to count on:\n- Instead of 2 + 9, think 9 + 2\n- Start at 9 and count up 2 more: 10, 11\n\n### Grouping Numbers Differently (Associative Property)\nThe associative property means we can group numbers in different ways when adding three or more numbers.\n\n**Example:**\n(2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4)\n- (2 + 3) + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9\n- 2 + (3 + 4) = 2 + 7 = 9\n\n### Why Is This Helpful?\nThis property helps us make easier number combinations like tens:\n\n**Example:**\n8 + 7 + 2 = ?\n- Regrouping: 8 + 2 + 7\n- (8 + 2) + 7 = 10 + 7 = 17\n\n### Fun Activities to Try:\n1. **Number Hunt:** Find different pairs that make the same sum\n2. **Number Chains:** Find different ways to group three numbers\n\n### Remember:\n- Addition can be done in any order (commutative)\n- Addition can be grouped in different ways (associative)\n- Both properties help us add numbers more easily!"

Sometimes it's easier to think about what number to add\n2. It helps with mental math strategies\n3. It builds a stronger understanding of how addition and subtraction are related\n\n### Real-Life Example:\nJamie has $7 but needs $10 to buy a toy. How much more money does Jamie need?\n\nWe can solve this two ways:\n- Subtraction: $10 - $7 = $3\n- Missing addend: $7 + ? = $10 → $3\n\n### Fact Families:\nAdd and subtract with the same numbers to see the relationship:\n- 6 + 5 = 11\n- 5 + 6 = 11\n- 11 - 5 = 6\n- 11 - 6 = 5"

It's faster than counting all numbers from the beginning.\n\n**Example:**\n6 + 3 = ?\n- Start with 6 (the larger number)\n- Count on 3 more: \"7, 8, 9\"\n- Answer: 6 + 3 = 9\n\n### When to Use Counting On:\n- When one number is much larger than the other\n- When you're comfortable counting from any starting point\n\n**Example:**\n24 + 2 = ?\n- Start with 24\n- Count on 2 more: \"25, 26\"\n- Answer: 24 + 2 = 26\n\n### Counting Back Strategy\n**Counting back** works well for subtraction. Start with the larger number and count backward.\n\n**Example:**\n8 - 3 = ?\n- Start with 8\n- Count back 3: \"7, 6, 5\"\n- Answer: 8 - 3 = 5\n\n### Counting by Groups\nCounting by 2s, 5s, or 10s helps us count larger collections quickly.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Counting by 2s: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10...\n- Counting by 5s: 5, 10, 15, 20...\n- Counting by 10s: 10, 20, 30, 40...\n\n### Using a Number Line\nA number line helps us visualize counting on and back:\n- To add: Jump forward on the number line\n- To subtract: Jump backward on the number line\n\n### Tips for Better Counting:\n1. Practice counting forward and backward from different starting points\n2. Use fingers to keep track of how many you've counted\n3. Look for patterns in numbers as you count"

Read the problem carefully\n2. Identify what you know\n3. Decide if you need to add or subtract\n4. Solve the problem\n5. Check if your answer makes sense\n\n**Addition Example:**\nSam has 45 stickers. His friend gives him 28 more stickers. How many stickers does Sam have now?\n- We know: Sam has 45 stickers and gets 28 more\n- Operation: Addition (45 + 28)\n- Answer: 73 stickers\n\n**Subtraction Example:**\nEmma had 63 crayons. She gave 19 crayons to her brother. How many crayons does Emma have left?\n- We know: Emma had 63 crayons and gave away 19\n- Operation: Subtraction (63 - 19)\n- Answer: 44 crayons"

Example:\n1. Let x = 0.\u03053 (which means 0.333…)\n2. Multiply by 10: 10x = 3.333…\n3. Subtract the original equation: 10x - x = 3.333… - 0.333…\n4. Simplify: 9x = 3 → x = 3/9 = 1/3\n\nThis technique works for any repeating decimal. \n\nUnderstanding repeating decimals is essential in algebra, number theory, and rational number operations."

The main types are translations, reflections, rotations, and dilations.\n\n### Types of Transformations:\n1. **Translations (Slides)**: Move a figure in a straight line without rotating or flipping it.\n   - Example: Moving a triangle 3 units right and 2 units up.\n\n2. **Reflections (Flips)**: Mirror a figure across a line.\n   - Example: Reflecting a shape across the y-axis.\n\n3. **Rotations (Turns)**: Turn a figure around a fixed point.\n   - Example: Rotating a square 90° clockwise around the origin.\n\n4. **Dilations (Resizing)**: Enlarge or reduce a figure by a scale factor.\n   - Example: Enlarging a rectangle by a scale factor of 2.\n\n### Congruence and Transformations:\nTwo figures are **congruent** if one can be transformed into the other using only translations, reflections, and rotations (not dilations).\n\n### Applications:\n- **Computer Graphics**: Creating animations and visual effects.\n- **Architecture**: Designing symmetrical structures.\n- **Art**: Creating patterns and designs with symmetry.\n\nUnderstanding transformations helps in **analyzing geometric relationships and spatial reasoning**."

The main types are translations, reflections, rotations, and dilations.\n\n### Types of Transformations:\n1. **Translations (Slides)**: Move a figure in a straight line without rotating or flipping it.\n   - Example: Moving a triangle 3 units right and 2 units up.\n\n2. **Reflections (Flips)**: Mirror a figure across a line.\n   - Example: Reflecting a shape across the y-axis.\n\n3. **Rotations (Turns)**: Turn a figure around a fixed point.\n   - Example: Rotating a square 90° clockwise around the origin.\n\n4. **Dilations (Resizing)**: Enlarge or reduce a figure by a scale factor.\n   - Example: Enlarging a rectangle by a scale factor of 2.\n\n### Congruence and Transformations:\nTwo figures are **congruent** if one can be transformed into the other using only translations, reflections, and rotations (not dilations).\n\n### Applications:\n- **Computer Graphics**: Creating animations and visual effects.\n- **Architecture**: Designing symmetrical structures.\n- **Art**: Creating patterns and designs with symmetry.\n\nUnderstanding transformations helps in **analyzing geometric relationships and spatial reasoning**."
