These numbers arise when dividing integers that do not result in terminating decimals. For example:\n\n- 1 ÷ 3 = 0.333… (3 repeats indefinitely)\n- 2 ÷ 7 = 0.285714285714… (285714 repeats indefinitely)\n\n### Identifying Repeating Decimals:\nRepeating decimals are usually represented with a bar notation: \n- 0.333… = 0.\u03053 (bar over 3)\n- 0.285714285714… = 0.\u0305285714 (bar over 285714)\n\n### Converting Repeating Decimals to Fractions:\nWe can express repeating decimals as fractions using algebra. Example:\n1. Let x = 0.\u03053 (which means 0.333…)\n2. Multiply by 10: 10x = 3.333…\n3. Subtract the original equation: 10x - x = 3.333… - 0.333…\n4. Simplify: 9x = 3 → x = 3/9 = 1/3\n\nThis technique works for any repeating decimal. \n\nUnderstanding repeating decimals is essential in algebra, number theory, and rational number operations."

Infinitely Many Solutions:\n- The equation simplifies to a **true statement**.\n- Example: **4x + 8 = 4(x + 2)** → 4x + 8 = 4x + 8 (always true)\n\n### Identifying Solutions Easily:\n| **Equation Type**      | **What Happens?**        | **Solution Count** |\n|------------------|------------------|---------------|\n| 2x + 3 = 9       | Solve for x      | **One**       |\n| 5x - 4 = 5x + 6  | Variables cancel, false equation | **No solution** |\n| 3(x - 2) = 3x - 6 | Variables cancel, true equation | **Infinite** |\n\n### Applications:\n- **Physics**: Checking if an equation has a valid physical solution.\n- **Engineering**: Solving force and stress equations.\n- **Computer Science**: Debugging equations in algorithms."

Together, they are 18 years old.\n- Define Sam’s age as **x** → Jake’s age is **2x**.\n- Write the equation: **x + 2x = 18**\n- Solve: **3x = 18**, so **x = 6** (Sam is 6, Jake is 12).\n\n### Example 2 (Money Problem):\n- A movie ticket costs $6 for children and $10 for adults.\n- If the total revenue was **$300**, and 20 child tickets were sold, how many adult tickets were sold?\n- Define **x = number of adult tickets**.\n- Equation: **6(20) + 10x = 300**\n- Solve: **120 + 10x = 300** → **10x = 180** → **x = 18**\n\n### Applications:\n- **Finance**: Budgeting problems.\n- **Business**: Profit and loss calculations.\n- **Engineering**: Material usage calculations.\n\nMastering word problems helps in **real-world problem-solving and critical thinking**."
