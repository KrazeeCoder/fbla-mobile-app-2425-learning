These are equations that contain only one unknown value, usually represented by a letter like x. The goal is to find the value of x that makes the equation true.\n\nWhat is a One-variable Equation?\nA one-variable equation is an equation that has only one variable (a letter like x, y, etc.) and constants (numbers). It usually looks like this:\n\nax + b = c\n\nWhere:\n- a is a number multiplying x\n- b is a constant added or subtracted to/from ax\n- c is a constant on the other side of the equation\n\nHow to Solve a One-variable Equation?\nTo solve a one-variable equation, you need to isolate the variable (x). You can do this by performing the same operation on both sides of the equation. Here are some common steps:\n\n1. Simplify both sides of the equation if needed. This means combining like terms.\n2. Use inverse operations (the opposite of what is done to x) to isolate the variable. You can add, subtract, multiply, or divide both sides of the equation by the same number.\n3. Check your solution by substituting your value for x back into the original equation to ensure both sides are equal.\n\nExample 1: Solve 3x = 15\n- Step 1: Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate x.\n- Step 2: 3x / 3 = 15 / 3\n- Step 3: x = 5\n\nExample 2: Solve x + 7 = 12\n- Step 1: Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate x.\n- Step 2: x + 7 - 7 = 12 - 7\n- Step 3: x = 5\n\nExample 3: Solve 4x - 8 = 12\n- Step 1: Add 8 to both sides of the equation.\n- Step 2: 4x = 12 + 8\n- Step 3: 4x = 20\n- Step 4: Divide both sides by 4 to isolate x.\n- Step 5: x = 5\n\nNow you can solve equations like these and check your answers by substituting the value of x back into the equation. Keep practicing with more examples to get better at solving one-variable equations!"
